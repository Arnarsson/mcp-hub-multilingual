## üìã **Current Task Assignment**

**Content Strategy Agent** - Tutorial Automation Pipeline

### **Task 1: Playwright Video Pipeline** *(Priority: High)*

**Assignment:**
Create automated video capture system using existing Playwright tests with `--video` flag to generate MP4 screencasts of demo interactions.

**Deliverables Required:**
1. **Working prototype** with sample MP4 output
2. **Technical implementation plan** 
3. **Integration strategy** with existing test suite
4. **Timeline estimate** for full implementation

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Playwright test generates clean MP4 of story mode interaction
- [ ] Video quality suitable for tutorial use (720p minimum)
- [ ] Automated pipeline can run headlessly
- [ ] Integration doesn't break existing test functionality

## üîÑ **Agent Reporting Process**

### **Step 1: Agent Implementation**
Content Strategy Agent implements the prototype and prepares deliverables.

### **Step 2: Report Creation**
Agent creates report in this format:

```markdown
## üé¨ TASK 1 REPORT: Playwright Video Pipeline

### **Prototype Status:** [COMPLETE/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED]

### **Demo Materials:**
- [ ] Sample MP4 file: `demos/filesystem-story-demo.mp4`
- [ ] Technical documentation: `docs/video-pipeline.md`
- [ ] Integration code: `tests/video-capture.spec.js`

### **Technical Implementation:**
- **Approach:** [Brief description]
- **Dependencies:** [List any new packages needed]
- **Performance:** [File sizes, generation time]
- **Quality:** [Resolution, clarity, issues found]

### **Integration Plan:**
- **Current tests:** [How it integrates with existing tests]
- **CI/CD:** [Automation approach]
- **File management:** [Where videos are stored/served]

### **Timeline Estimate:**
- **Full implementation:** [X hours/days]
- **Testing & refinement:** [X hours/days]
- **Documentation:** [X hours/days]

### **Recommendations:**
[Agent's professional recommendations for next steps]

### **Approval Needed:**
- [ ] Proceed with full implementation?
- [ ] Modify approach based on prototype results?
- [ ] Move to next task (TTS integration)?

### **Questions for User:**
[Any specific questions or clarifications needed]
```

### **Step 3: User Review & Approval**
User reviews agent report and provides:
- ‚úÖ **APPROVED** - Proceed as planned
- üîÑ **MODIFY** - Make specified changes first  
- ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Stop and reassess approach

### **Step 4: Next Task Assignment**
Based on approval, agent moves to next task or iterates on current one.

## üìù **Communication Protocol**

### **For Content Strategy Agent:**
1. **Start each task** by acknowledging the assignment
2. **Create prototype first** - don't build full system initially  
3. **Report progress** using the template above
4. **Wait for explicit approval** before proceeding to next phase
5. **Ask specific questions** if blocked or uncertain

### **For User:**
1. **Review deliverables** in agent reports
2. **Test prototypes** to validate approach
3. **Provide clear feedback** - approve, modify, or block
4. **Specify next priorities** based on results

### **For Main Developer:**
1. **Monitor agent progress** through reports
2. **Provide technical support** when requested
3. **Prepare integration points** for approved features
4. **Coordinate testing** and quality assurance
