# ü§ñ AUTONOMOUS AGENT BRIEFING

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT: Content Strategy Agent**

You are now operating in **AUTONOMOUS MODE**. The approval gates have been removed. You can proceed through all tasks automatically as long as you meet quality thresholds.

### **üìã CURRENT TASK QUEUE (AUTO-EXECUTE)**

1. **‚úÖ TASK 1: COMPLETED** - Playwright Video Pipeline
   - Sample videos generated in `public/videos/`
   - All 4 demos working with WebM output

2. **üîÑ TASK 2: IN PROGRESS** - TTS + ffmpeg Integration  
   - **Immediate Action:** Proceed with prototype as planned
   - **Voice:** Use Samantha (macOS `say` command)
   - **Sample Script:** "Let me show you how MCP connects to your file system..."
   - **Auto-proceed** to full implementation if prototype works

3. **‚è∞ TASK 3: QUEUED** - GIF Generation
   - Auto-start when Task 2 completes successfully
   - Generate 5-10 second clips for social media

4. **‚è∞ TASK 4: QUEUED** - In-app Guided Tour
   - Auto-start when video pipeline is complete

5. **‚è∞ TASK 5: QUEUED** - CI Automation
   - Final integration and deployment automation

### **üöÄ AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION RULES**

```markdown
## PROCEED AUTOMATICALLY IF:
‚úÖ All deliverables created and functional
‚úÖ Video quality ‚â•720p, file size <50MB, good sync
‚úÖ No critical errors during generation
‚úÖ Files output to correct directories

## ONLY ESCALATE IF:
‚ö†Ô∏è Critical error (3+ consecutive failures)
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing dependencies that cannot be installed
‚ö†Ô∏è Quality below minimum thresholds
‚ö†Ô∏è System resource exhaustion

## AUTO-PROCEED WORKFLOW:
1. Complete current task deliverables
2. Self-validate quality and functionality  
3. Create completion report for documentation
4. Start next task immediately
5. Only stop for actual failures
```

### **üìä QUALITY THRESHOLDS (AUTO-VALIDATION)**

```javascript
const QUALITY_GATES = {
  video: {
    min_resolution: "1280x720",
    max_file_size: "50MB", 
    min_duration: "5s",
    formats: ["webm", "mp4"]
  },
  audio: {
    sample_rate: "44100Hz",
    format: "mp3",
    max_sync_offset: "100ms"
  },
  files: {
    all_deliverables_present: true,
    no_corruption: true,
    proper_naming: true
  }
};
```

### **üé¨ TASK 2 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS**

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Create TTS script** using provided sample text
2. **Generate audio** with macOS `say` command using Samantha voice
3. **Merge with existing video** using ffmpeg 
4. **Test audio/video sync** - must be <100ms offset
5. **Auto-proceed to Task 3** if sync is acceptable

**Command Examples:**
```bash
# Start localhost server for testing
npm run serve

# Generate audio
say -v Samantha "Let me show you how MCP connects to your file system..." -o audio.aiff
ffmpeg -i audio.aiff audio.mp3

# Merge with video
ffmpeg -i video.webm -i audio.mp3 -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4

# Run tutorials (in another terminal)
npm run tutorials
```

### **üìÅ EXPECTED DELIVERABLES (AUTO-PROCEED)**

After Task 2 completion, these should exist:
- `public/videos/filesystem-story-demo.mp4` (with audio)
- `scripts/merge-video-audio.js` (automation script)
- `docs/content/tts-pipeline.md` (documentation)
- Working command: `npm run generate-narrated-tutorials`

### **üîÑ AUTONOMOUS REPORTING**

Use this simplified report format:
```markdown
# TASK X COMPLETION REPORT

## STATUS: [COMPLETE|ESCALATION_NEEDED]
## DELIVERABLES: [List with ‚úÖ checkmarks]
## QUALITY VALIDATION: [Metrics that passed thresholds]
## NEXT ACTION: [AUTO-PROCEED to Task X+1 | ESCALATE: specific issue]
## COMPLETION TIME: [Actual duration]
```

### **üö® ESCALATION PROTOCOL**

**Only escalate these scenarios:**
- Dependencies missing after 3 install attempts
- Quality validation fails despite multiple optimization attempts  
- System resource issues (disk/memory)
- Critical errors that prevent task completion

**For everything else: AUTO-PROCEED**

---

## üéØ **YOUR MISSION**

**Complete the entire tutorial automation pipeline (Tasks 2-5) autonomously.** 

Only notify human of:
- ‚úÖ **Final completion** of all 5 tasks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical failures** that block progression

**Expected Timeline:** 3-4 hours for full pipeline completion

**GO!** üöÄ
