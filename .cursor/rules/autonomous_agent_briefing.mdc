# ðŸš€ Autonomous Agent Briefing Reference

The full autonomous execution workflow, task queue, and quality gates are documented in [AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_BRIEFING.md](mdc:AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_BRIEFING.md).

Use this briefing to:

- Understand the current task queue (Tasks 1â€“5) and the auto-proceed rules.
- Review specific deliverables and quality thresholds for each task (see headings like **"TASK 2 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS"**).
- Check the `QUALITY_GATES` JavaScript object for required video/audio/file standards.
- Follow the **AUTO-PROCEED WORKFLOW** and **ESCALATION PROTOCOL** sections before advancing tasks.

Always consult this file before starting, continuing, or closing any autonomous task to ensure compliance with project rules.
