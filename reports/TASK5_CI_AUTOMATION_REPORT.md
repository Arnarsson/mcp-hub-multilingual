# TASK 5 COMPLETION REPORT: CI Automation

## STATUS: IMPLEMENTED (awaiting first run on GitHub Actions)

## DELIVERABLES:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/tutorial-pipeline.yml` – full Playwright → MP4 → GIF pipeline
- ✅ `npm run pipeline` script in `package.json`

## PIPELINE STEPS
1. Checkout & Node setup (v18 with npm cache)  
2. `npm ci` – install deps  
3. Install Playwright browsers (`--with-deps`)  
4. Install `ffmpeg` via apt  
5. Run `npm run pipeline` which:
   • Executes Playwright tests to capture video  
   • Merges audio with video → `public/videos/...mp4`  
   • Generates 8-s GIF clip  
6. Uploads MP4 & GIF as workflow artifacts

## VALIDATION PLAN
• Push to `main` triggers run – expect green check & artifacts.  
• Pull-request runs to ensure visuals stay up-to-date.

## NEXT STEPS (post-MVP)
• Cache Playwright browsers to speed up build  
• Parallel matrix for multiple demos  
• Deploy artifacts to Netlify/Vercel preview

## COMPLETION TIME
~30 min
