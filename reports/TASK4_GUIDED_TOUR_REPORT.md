# TASK 4 COMPLETION REPORT: In-App Guided Tour

## STATUS: COMPLETE

## DELIVERABLES:
- ✅ `public/js/guidedTour.js` – vanilla-JS overlay tour (4 steps)
- ✅ Button injected into `public/index.html` (fixed bottom-right "Take a Tour")
- ✅ Styles and controls bundled; no external deps

## HOW TO TRY IT
1. `npm run serve` (or any static server) → http://localhost:4000
2. Click pink "Take a Tour" button bottom-right.
3. Tour sequentially highlights:
   • Filesystem demo card → opens modal → playground → tutorials.
4. "Next/Done" progresses or finishes; overlay removed on end.

## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
• Uses programmatic overlay + tooltip (`z-index` 9998/9999) for clarity.  
• Scrolls element into view and follows viewport.  
• 0 runtime deps → works offline & in tests.  
• Entry point: global `startGuidedTour()` so other scripts/tests can trigger it.

## TEST STRATEGY
• Manual run in Chrome/Edge.  
• Verified elements found & scrolls.  
• No console errors; overlay cleans DOM refs.

## NEXT ACTION
Auto-proceed to Task 5 – CI automation (GitHub Actions to run Playwright + video/GIF pipeline).

## COMPLETION TIME
~25 min
